  <h1>📜 Triple Threat TTTLCO Official Contract Page</h1>

  <p id="contractText">
    Welcome to The Triple Threat Law Contract Organisation, known shortly as TTTLCO. We are the full creators, owners,
    and managers of The Triple Threat (TTT) YouTube Network and its community. This is an official agreement page,
    and it contains all the critical rules, responsibilities, expectations, benefits, and consequences that any member
    must agree to before signing.

    TTT is an entertaining, educational, and problem-solving group of content creators. We strive to inspire creativity,
    promote fun challenges, educational insights, and team bonding through digital platforms like YouTube. We engage
    audiences with exciting gameplay, community interaction, and real-time events.

    As a member of the TTT system, you are required to:
    <br><br>
    ✅ Appear online at least **four times a week**<br>
    ✅ Spend a minimum of **2 hours daily** on TTT activities<br>
    ✅ Respect all members and never reveal their **real identities**<br>
    ✅ **Avoid** any fraud, scam, offensive, or insultive behavior<br>
    ✅ Stay **active** and contribute regularly in videos, challenges, and team discussions<br>

    📦 Your rewards include:<br>
    - Shared YouTube **fame** with the entire team<br>
    - **Monthly opportunities** for public appearances and sponsorships<br>
    - 💰 Paid according to subscribers (e.g., 1000 subs = ₦20,000 per 6 months)<br>

    ❗ If you break any of these rules, here are the consequences:<br>
    - You will be **kicked out** of TTT immediately<br>
    - You will be **exposed online** as untrustworthy<br>
    - You will be **forced to return any money earned** or risk having your account accessed/hacked<br>

    The full contract goes beyond YouTube. It includes code of conduct, responsibility over content, community
    engagement, copyrights, creative freedom, and discipline. You will be added to internal TTT groups and must be
    responsible, loyal, and focused.

    We do **not tolerate laziness**, and fake members will be banned permanently.

    All TTT projects are serious. Whether you're doing role-play, tutorials, competitions, or announcements, it must be
    done with quality. TTTLCO has the power to review your participation, behavior, and progress every 30 days.

    TTTLCO members who show high-level creativity will earn bonuses. All data and content are protected. Any leak,
    theft, or external sharing of private media will result in suspension and legal action.

    🚀 The future of TTT includes public meetups, exclusive team training, interviews, social recognition, gaming
    tournaments, and possibly international collaborations.

    If you agree with everything, let the bot read this contract **out loud** and after it's done speaking, you'll be
    able to click "Sign In" to continue.
